# Reading Between the Lines: A NLP approach to Sarcasm Detection
### Authors: Sion Chun, Meyhar Sharma, Tejas Chhotulal Badgujar, Ritayan Patra

Sarcasm is tricky to understand and even harder to identify using computers in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). It often relies on special ways of saying things and a deep knowledge of the language, which even humans
sometimes struggle with. Detecting sarcasm is especially important in public communication, like news headlines.
Knowing if a headline is sarcastic or not can help understand the writerâ€™s true intent and what the article might be about. It
also affects how many people decide to read the article based on the headline. This project aims to create a machine
learning model using NLP to figure out if a news headline is sarcastic or not (a binary classification).


The complete code with data preprocessing and model building and evaluation is in the file sarcasm_final_v2.ipynb
In the project, we have used Python and NLP releated libraries like nltk, tensorflow, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and many more.
We have build and experimented with wide variety of models ranging from classical machine learning models like random forest, extra trees, xgboost, catboost to deep learning models like LSTM, RNN and pretrained models like bert.
